# Matrix based calculator
This is my final project for Programming Fundamentals in the first semester of university. 
## Description
In this project, we will create a matrix-based calculator capable of performing the four main matrix operations: addition, multiplication, division, and subtraction. Additionally, the calculator can calculate the determinant of a matrix. The size of the matrix will not exceed 100 numbers. The program will include two variables, A and B, and the user can execute various calculation tasks using specific commands.

Here are the available commands and their functions: <br/>
1- Input matrix A <br/>
2- Input matrix B <br/>
3- Transfer data from A to B <br/>
4- Transfer data from B to A <br/>
5- Calculate A = A * B <br/>
6- Calculate A = A + B <br/>
7- Calculate A = A / B <br/>
8- Calculate A = A - B <br/>
9- Calculate A = a * A <br/>
10- Calculate determinant of matrix A <br/>
11- Calculate determinant of matrix B <br/>
12- Print matrix A <br/>
13- Print matrix B <br/>

+ When receiving matrices, the program will prompt the user for the matrix size. During the execution of operations, the program will validate the necessary conditions for each operation. If the calculations cannot be performed, an error message will be displayed.
